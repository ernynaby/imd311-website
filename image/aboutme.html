I loves surrounded with people but sometimes, I feel
<br>
 like i'm not fit with the community. I feel left behind
<br>
 but still i try to catch up with them and try to be close
<br>
 but i know at the end of the day still i'm introvert person.</font></td>

Everytime i allowed anyone to make me feel  
<br>
unworthy, i always reminded myself that i  
<br>
wiped my own tears a billion times before,
<br>
took care of myself when i didn't feel pretty,
<br>
i fed myself my favourite foods when my bad 
<br>
days and loved myself when i felt unloved. so 
<br>
wo why would i let anyone who can only make me
<br>
feel miserable be a part of my life? everytime
<br>
i got hurt, i ended up choosing myself again.</font></td>

Here's quotes i want share to everyone

The most wonderful moment in a woman's  
<br>
life is when she realizes she can do whatever  
<br>
 she wants, and she not sowe anyone an explanation
<br>
 and she doesn't need anyone's permission.</font></td>
